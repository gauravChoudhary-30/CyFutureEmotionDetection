# CyFutureEmotionDetection 💬💡

CyFutureEmotionDetection is a deep learning-based text classification project that detects emotions from short English messages using TensorFlow and NLP preprocessing. This project is ideal for enhancing conversational agents, mental health platforms, or sentiment-aware applications.

## 🔍 Overview

This model can classify a given text message into one of six emotions:

- 😢 Sadness  
- 😊 Joy  
- ❤️ Love  
- 😡 Anger  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😲 Surprise

## 📦 Features

- Preprocessing using `Tokenizer` and `pad_sequences`
- Model built with TensorFlow & Keras
- Trained on labeled emotion dataset (text, label)
- Emotion prediction function for real-world input testing
- Easily extendable and ready for deployment

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Load and clean dataset**
2. **Preprocess the text**: tokenize and pad sequences
3. **Train the model** using LSTM layers
4. **Evaluate and save the model**
5. **Predict emotion** for any custom message

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
````

### 2. Run the Notebook

Open and execute `CyFutureEmotionDetection.ipynb` in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or Google Colab.

### 3. Predict Emotions

Use the `predict_emotion` function to test any message:

```python
predict_emotion("I can't believe I won!", tokenizer, model)
# Output: ['surprise']
```

## 📊 Model Performance

* Training Accuracy: \~98%
* Validation Accuracy: \~97%
* Loss: Efficient convergence over epochs

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NLP (Text Tokenization)
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas / Numpy / Seaborn / Matplotlib

## 💬 Example Predictions

| Text                                       | Predicted Emotion |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| "I’m so proud of what we accomplished!"    | joy               |
| "Why am I always so nervous before exams?" | fear              |
| "They mean the world to me."               | love              |
| "I can’t stop crying."                     | sadness           |

## 📈 Future Work

* Expand training with more diverse datasets
* Deploy as a Flask or FastAPI REST API
* Create a Streamlit or React frontend
* Fine-tune with multilingual support
